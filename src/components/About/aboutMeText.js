  `I am working to become a professional front-end engineer with the goal of moving into
  full stack. I discovered my passion for coding when taking computer science courses and front end
  satisfied my need to see immediate feedback with what I was building. The fun in front end is
  building websites with syntactically valid HTML, adding responsiveness through CSS and HTML
  attributes, ensuring my JS/TS respects runtime and spacetime complexities, and using React to
  create DRY components.`,

  `In my decade of work experience in other fields, I have demonstrated myself to be a team player,
  someone who perseveres in the face of challenges, and who owns his mistakes and continually seeks
  to improve. In my private and professional life, I take responsibility for my education and
  growth. This is the stance I had to learn while self-studying front end. As your next front-end
  engineer, I will be proactive to write efficient code, hungry to learn, and focused on the needs
  of the team and the product. Outside of programming, I am passionate about weightlifting, shogi,
  and sustainability.`
