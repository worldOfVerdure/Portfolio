  `I have a passion for software engineering, computer science, and the mathematics that underpins
  these systems. This passion began to take shape in 2019 when I switched from a mathematics major 
  to computer science. UCF taught algorithims, data structures and runtimes which looking back
  naturally lended itself to backend. Many of the problems revolved around getting large text files
  and being able to parse them with various alogorithms which satisfied the mathematics parts of my
  brain, yet I was struggling to see what I could build with these techniques.`,
  
  `I had to step away from school to focus on working in 2022, still unsure exactly what I wanted to
  do with what I was learning. In 2023, I had come across the idea of website development. I wrote
  my first HTML boilerplate, and placed an h1 element with the string, "Hello World". Seeing the
  words appear on my screen was a lightbulb moment for me. I knew I wanted to learn these Frontend
  systems as a means providing information, services and technologies with an internet connection
  and a browser. Having to work, I chose 3rd shifts to code at night while providing for myself. I
  learnt HTML in a security vehicle. Javascript and CSS was studied while working in client's homes
  as a caregiver. Since, I have moved on to React, enjoying the declarative programming paradigm
  with Styled-Components being my go-to library for writing CSS.`,

  `I still have a great deal to learn. I am currently studying aditional React topics such as prop
  drilling and other hooks. I've been learning Typescript to have statically typed language whose
  OOP sytanx better reflects Java which I worked with at UCF. I want to further improve in frontend.
  I have also been pressing into the backend with Node.js and Express.js and would one day want to
  see myself as a fullstack engineer. After such, I would finish my degree. I have recently been
  studying graph theory as it could lend to utilization of graph theory algorithims and networking
  science. I am seeking to work as a frontend engineer and am improving in typescript so that I can
  begin collaborating with other Github users.`
